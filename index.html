<h1> So Cold </h1>
<ph> You can't hear me cry
See my dreams all die
From where you're standing
on your own

It's so quiet here
And I feel so cold
This house no longer
Feels like home

When you told me you'd leave
I felt like I couldn't breath
My aching body fell to the floor

Then I called you at home
You said you weren't alone
I should have known better
Now it hurts much more

You caused my heart to bleed and
You still owe me a reason
Cause I can't figure out why

Why I'm alone and freezing
While you are in the bed that she's in
And I'm just felt alone to cry

You caused my heart to bleed and
You still owe me a reason
Cause I can't figure out why(x2)

You can't hear me cry
See my dreams all die
From where you're standing
on your own

It's so quiet here
And I feel so cold
This house no longer
Feels like home
